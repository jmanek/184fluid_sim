Comments on project:
In my opinion, this project was a bust. Due to a horrible midterm season, I was forced to put this project off until the last minute. As such, this project is both incomplete and late. While I did get my portion of the subdivision working (the uniform subdivision geometry is correct, as it is implemented directly off of Professor O'Brien's slides, the shading is incorrect. Whether this is because of some unknown OpenGL error, I cannot say. All camera transformations are based on the bounding sphere algorithm detailed at http://www.opengl.org/archives/resources/faq/technical/viewing.htm, while lighting and depth buffer manipulations are based off of http://www.opengl.org/archives/resources/faq/technical/depthbuffer.htm. 

As for Jesse's portion, he was put in charge of the adaptive tesselation portion of this assignment. At the time of this submission (~9:30 PM on Monday the 19th), his portion currently shows a black screen. Whether he will get this working in the upcoming future is on him, I cannot comment.

Overall, a lack of communication between partners as well as a procrastination on my part have resulted in a poor showing for this project. I look forward to the final project as an opportunity to prove that this is a one time occurrence.
